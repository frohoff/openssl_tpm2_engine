load_tpm2_key - load a tpm2 key at a permanent index

[description]

Used to load keys created by create_tpm2_key(1) to a permanent
NV index.

The reasons for doing this are either to have an unrestricted key
always accessible to the TPM without needing a key file or to have a
new restricted decryption key parent from which other keys can be
created as children.

[examples]

Create a TPM internal key and load it at index 81000101

    create_tpm2_key -p 81000001 tmp.key
    load_tpm2_key tmp.key 81000101

Create a wrapped restricted decryption key at 81000101 and use it
as the parent of a new key

    openssl genrsa 2048 > key.priv
    create_tpm2_key --restricted -w key.priv key.tpm
    load_tpm2_key key.tpm 81000101
    create_tpm2_key -p 81000101 newkey.tpm
