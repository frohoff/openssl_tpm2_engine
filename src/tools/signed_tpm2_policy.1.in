[name]
signed_tpm2_policy - add, remove and list signed policies

[description]

<cmd> is one of add, rm or ls and [arg] is the private key for the add
command or the policy number for the rm command.



[PCR Values]

The PCR values are specified as

 <bank>:<list>

Where <bank> is any supported PCR hash bank and list specifies the
PCRs to lock the key to as both comma separated individual values as
well as comma separated ranges.  So

 sha256:1,3 means PCRs 1 and 3 in the sha256 bank

 sha512:1,3-5 means PCRs 1,3,4 and 5 in the sha512 bank

[Secrets in Other Objects]

When the option --secrets <handle> is used, it creates a key whose
authorization password is conditioned on the password of a different
object identified by <handle>.  Usually this is a permanent NV index,
but could be any object.  The design of this policy is to allow the
password to be changed without updating the key (simply by changing
the authorization of the other object).  Because OpenSSL can only
request a single password, keys with a --secret policy may not
additionally have an --auth option to also require passing in the
password embedded in the key.

[examples]

list all signed policies:

    signed_tpm2_policy ls key.tpm

The output is a numbered list of policies (with optional names)

remove the first policy

    signed_tpm2_policy rm key.tpm 1

add a new policy with name 'thispolicy' locked to pcr16 using the
private policy.key:

    signed_tpm2_policy add --name thispolicy --pcr-lock sha256:16 key.tmp policy.key
