unseal_tpm2_data - unseal a blob of data using a TPM

[description]

Once a sealed data blob has been created, it may only be unsealed by
the TPM for which it was created.  This command attempts that unseal
operation

[examples]

Create a sealed data blob to the storage parent (owner hierarchy)

    echo "somedatatoseal" seal_tpm2_key -a -k passw0rd -p owner seal.tpm

Unseal the data

    unseal_tpm2_key -k passw0rd seal.tpm
