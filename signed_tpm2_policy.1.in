[PCR Values]

The PCR values are specified as

Where <bank> is any supported PCR hash bank and list specifies the
PCRs to lock the key to as both comma separated individual values as
well as comma separated ranges.  So

    signed_tpm2_policy ls key.tpm

The output is a numbered list of policies (with optional names)

remove the first policy

    signed_tpm2_policy rm key.tpm 1

add a new policy with name 'thispolicy' locked to pcr16 using the
private policy.key:

    signed_tpm2_policy add --name thispolicy --pcr-lock sha256:16 key.tmp policy.key
