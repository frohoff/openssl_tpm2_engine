seal_tpm2_data - seal a blob of data for a TPM

[description]

Used to create a sealed blob of data which can be unsealed via the
TPM.  Possible uses for this blob of data include as a symmetric key,
which is the use in the linux kernel trusted key infrastructure.

[PCR Values]

The PCR values are specified as

 <bank>:<list>

Where <bank> is any supported PCR hash bank and list specifies the
PCRs to lock the key to as both comma separated individual values as
well as comma separated ranges.  So

 sha256:1,3 means PCRs 1 and 3 in the sha256 bank

 sha512:1,3-5 means PCRs 1,3,4 and 5 in the sha512 bank

[Signed Policies]

When the option --signed-policy <key> is used, it creates a sealed
blob whose policy can be extended by anyone possessing the private
part of <key>.  The <key> presented must be a public key (so the owner
of the private key doesn't have to be the owner of the created tpm
sealed blob).

Note that sealed blobs created with --signed-policy cannot be used
until at least one signed policy is added.

[examples]

Create a sealed data blob to the storage parent (owner hierarchy)

    echo somedatatoseal | seal_tpm2_key -p owner seal.tpm

Unseal the data

    unseal_tpm2_key seal.tpm
